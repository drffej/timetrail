##  The Lake Loop TT course:

Two laps of the lake, starting at the boat house end of the lake, around the red buoy by the statue at the end of the lake and back down the other side of the Islands to the start, then repeat for the 2nd lap.  It should take 26 to 45 minutes to complete.

START and FINISH:
The start and finish is the red buoy next to the moored dragon boat and outriggers. The red buoy is the 2nd one from the end (i.e. just before the orange one).  Start and finish on the right of the buoy, in the direction you are heading.

THE TURN:
The turn point is down the end of the lake near the statue.   It is a red buoy, turn counter-clock wise and head to right hand side of the Islands back to the boat house.  The turn for the 2nd lap is counter-clock wise around the start red buoy.

COURSE:
The course follows the normal circulation route on the lake, keep an eye out for other paddlers and rowers.  If you cut corners, you time will not count.
