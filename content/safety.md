# Safety

One of the main ideas behind the challenge is encourage independent paddling on Trentham Lake.  If you consider undertaking one of the challenges then you must ensure that you fully understand, appreciate and accept the risks involved. You need to take entire responsibility for your actions and for the safety of yourself and any others involved.  

Please ensure you read and understand the [Trentham Canoe Club Paddler Policy](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11EhDrVyTXSoiYzUq1QNy-JNQAecKcHPW) before doing the challenges.

If you are not FULLY confident in your abilities ask an experienced club member to do it with you.

If you want to LEARN how do the challenges safely or go about independent paddling - ask one of the club coaches for help.


CRAFT:
- Kayak K1/K2/K4, Ski, SUP, Dragon Boat, Canadian, Bell Boat and Outrigger are all acceptable craft - but they must be good condition with internal buoyancy
- All paddlers should be capable of paddling their chosen craft safely for the current lake condition and weather
- All craft are to be rendered unsinkable, either by manufacturer design (bulkheads etc.) or via extra buoyancy devices (fitted airbags etc.)

SAFETY:

-  Before paddling a challenge, undertake an assessment of risk - e.g. lake conditions, wind, personal ability, clothing and craft
-  Ensure you are capable of handling any hazards on the lake e.g fishermen, rowers, Miss Elizabeth, trees, shallow water, weed

-  Ensure you signin and signout your lake session in the boat house log book
-  Leave details of your proposed paddle and timings with a 3rd party
-  We make no claim or assurance that the Lake is safe on the day of your paddle.  You need to do risk assessment on the day of paddle that the challenge is a safe and realistic proposition.
